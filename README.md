## Introduction

A reading list for a journal club and special topics class. A tentative title is: 

`Unconventional approaches in AI and CS: transdisciplinarity, complex systems perspectives, participatory design, ethics and explainability`

### Human computer interaction

Computer scientist as toolsmith 2

https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/227234.227243

  * > In contrast with many engineers who make houses, cars, medicines, and clothing for human need and enjoyment, we make    things that do not themselves directly satisfy human needs, but which others use in making things that enrich human living. In a word, the computer scientist is a toolsmith—no more, but no less. It is an honorable calling. If we perceive our role aright, we then see more clearly the proper criterion for success: a toolmaker succeeds as, and only as, the users of his tool succeed with his aid. However shining the blade, however jeweled the hilt, however perfect the heft, a sword is tested only by cutting. That swordsmith is successful whose clients die of old age.

  * > The scientist builds in order to study; the engineer studies in order to build.

### Postcolonial/decolonial theories applied to AI

Decolonial AI: Decolonial Theory as Sociotechnical Foresight in Artificial Intelligence

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-020-00405-8

> A decolonial framework helps connect instances of algorithmic oppression to wider socio-political and cultural contexts, enabling a geographically, historically and intersectionally expansive analysis of risks and opportunities pertaining to AI systems. Notably, it allows for the analysis to move beyond North American or European identity frameworks or definitions of harms. By connecting instances of algorithmic oppression across geographies, new approaches that consider alternative possibilities of using technology in socially complex settings in more critical and considered ways will emerge, and so too will designs that incorporate inclusive and well-adapted mechanisms of oversight and redress from the start.
